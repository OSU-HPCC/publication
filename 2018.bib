	title={Fluid Dynamic Mechanisms of Power Augmentation in Vertical Axis Wind Turbines},
	journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
	pages={223},
	abstract={Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, this study examines passive flow control in drag-based and lift-based vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). In drag based VAWTs (D-VAWT) such as the Savonius wind turbine, the use of a stator enclosure with non-moving blades for the purpose of channeling flow into the VAWT was found to generate high pressures upstream of the stator. The stator successfully increased power output, but the power augmentation was limited because the upstream pressure field influences flow to divert around the VAWT. The observed power output was lower than would generated by a rotor with the same diameter as the stator. In contrast, lift based VAWTs (L-VAWT) such as the Darrieus wind turbine have been shown to channel flow when counter-rotating pairs of L-VAWTs are located in close proximity. This study found that power augmentation in two side-by-side L-VAWTs primarily occurs due to a reduction in bypass flow (volumetric flow rate of air entering the rotor relative to unobstructed free stream flow). In a typical L-VAWT, the rotation of the rotor blades creates a high-pressure field upstream of the rotor as it removes energy from the wind and slows down the airflow that passes through the rotor. Normally, this high-pressure field re-directs on the order of 50\% of the incoming air volume around the turbine reducing the potential power output of the turbine. When two counter-rotating L-VAWTs were placed in close proximity, this study found that the bypass flow that would normally pass to the side of the adjacent turbine was re-directed back into the rotor, reducing the total bypass by around 10\% while generating up to 13.6\% more power. Thus, the same mechanism that limited power augmentation in D-VAWTs contributed to power augmentation in L-VAWTs. An additional power augmentation mechanism for L-VAWTs was studied by intermeshing the adjacent L-VAWT rotors together like a set of gears. Power augmentation was found to exceed the augmentation previously reported in counter-rotating L-VAWTs separated by a gap. This power augmentation was accomplished without further reducing bypass flow.},

	title={Ionic Liquids: The Importance of Local Structures at Micro- and Mesoscale and Descriptors to Tune Them},
	journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
	pages={297},
	abstract={Ionic liquids (ILs) are novel chemical substances composed entirely of ions. The negligible vapor pressure coupled with the ability to design an IL by judicious choice of cations and anions or their substituent functional groups makes them attractive candidates for replacement of volatile organic compounds used in the chemical industry. According to one estimate, as many as one million ILs could be designed from the available cation-anion combinations. However, trial-and-error based experimentation approach of synthesizing new ILs and measuring properties to identify an IL suitable for a given task is expensive and inefficient. The need for fast and efficient discovery of new materials mandates that we recognize and develop design principles to screen materials without a priori knowledge of their properties. This dissertation is primarily directed towards designing ILs for a particular application by understanding molecular interactions, responsible for their macroscopic properties, using molecular simulations approach. The first part of the dissertation focuses on efforts to design or screen binary mixtures of ILs for tuning phase equilibria properties. The results indicate a structure-property correlation, at least qualitatively, between significant differences in molar volume and hydrogen-bond acceptor ability of the anions, that constitute the mixture, and molecular organization of ions within the mixture. This relationship allows us to fundamentally envisage the presence of ideal/non-ideal characteristics, which can further be exploited for better CO2 absorption, relative to pure IL analogues, making them potential candidates for the application of gas separation processes. The second part of the dissertation focuses on engineering the self-assembly of amphiphilic ILs bearing long-alkyl chains, that exhibit liquid crystal-like behavior relevant for applications such as reaction media, liquid crystalline biosensors, synthesis of nanoparticles, and storage and stabilization of biological materials. For the simultaneous presence of nonpolar moieties on both cation and anion, the morphology at mesoscopic scale changes from sponge-like (less ordered) to layer-like (highly ordered) with an increase in cationic alkyl chain length, provided alkyl chain on the anion is long enough to show nanoscale segregation singlehandedly. Further, for an optimum combination of cationic and anionic chain length nanoscale heterogeneities spanning over multiple length scales are observed; the aggregation behavior of which can be further tuned by the addition of another, less amphiphilic, IL and dilution with organic solvents such as water. Insights obtained from this work suggests that the vital step towards engineering the morphologies at different length scales is the ability to tune the relevant interparticle interactions.},
