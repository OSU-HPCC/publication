# publication
Script for generating markdown list of publications which have used OSU HPCC. Provides version control and a way to generate a markdown list that can be ported to any content management system for the HPCC website. **Note:** The markdown file in this directory renders nicely on GitHub, but it is not the canonical list of publications. See the team folder in `publications`. The purpose of these files is to generate content quickly that can be posted to the website once the Google Docs list has been changed or updated. The Google Doc should be considered the official, up-to-date version. If it differs from the website, then use these scripts and update the website.

Note to self: In the future it might be nice to make a gh-pages and link to it from the HPCC website. That would streamline the workflow.
