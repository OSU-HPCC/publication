	abstract = {This paper puts forth a modular dynamic subgrid scale modeling framework for large eddy simulation of quasigeostrophic turbulence based on minimizing the errors between structural and functional subgrid scale models. The approximate deconvolution (AD) procedure is used to estimate the free modeling parameters for the eddy viscosity coefficient parameterized in space and time using the Smagorinsky and Leith models. The novel idea here is to estimate the modeling parameters using the AD method rather than the traditionally used test filtering approach. First, a-priori and a-posteriori analyses are presented for solving a canonical homogeneous isotropic decaying turbulence problem. The proposed model is then applied to a wind-driven quasigeostrophic four-gyre ocean circulation problem, which is a standard prototype of more realistic ocean dynamics. Results show that the proposed model captures the quasi-stationary ocean dynamics and provides the time averaged four-gyre circulation patterns. Taking locally resolved flow characteristics into account, the model dynamically provides higher eddy viscosity values for lower resolutions.},

We combined the prospective tests of SAMPL5 with followup retrospective calculations, to improve two technical aspects of the field variant of SEA. First, SEA uses an approximate analytical surface around the solute on which a water potential is computed. We have improved and simplified the mathematical model of that surface. Second, some of the solutes in SAMPL5 were large enough to need a way to treat solvating waters interacting with Âburied atomsÂ, i.e. interior atoms of the solute. We improved SEA with a buried-atom correction. We also compare SEA to Thermodynamic Integration molecular dynamics simulations, so that we can sort out force field errors.},

Accurate estimations of transfer between phases with significantly different polarities can be difficult because of the static nature of the force fields. Here, we report on an application of such calculations in the SAMPL5 experiment that also involves an effort in balancing solute and solvent interactions via their expected static dielectric constants. This strategy performs well with respect to predictive accuracy and correlation with unknown experimental values. We follow this by performing a series of retrospective investigations which highlight the potential importance of proper balancing in these systems, and we use a null hypothesis analysis to explore potential biases in the comparisons with experiment. The collective findings indicate that considerations of force field compatibility through dielectric behavior is a potential strategy for future improvements in transfer processes between disparate environments.},

	abstract = {Some investigators have shown tumor cell killing enhancement in vitro and tumor regression in mice associated with the loading of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) before proton treatments. Several Monte Carlo (MC) investigations have also demonstrated GNP-mediated proton dose enhancement. However, further studies need to be done to quantify the individual physical factors that contribute to the dose enhancement or cell-kill enhancement (or radiosensitization). Thus, the current study investigated the contributions of particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE), particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE), Auger and secondary electrons, and activation products towards the total dose enhancement. Specifically, GNP-mediated dose enhancement was measured using strips of radiochromic film that were inserted into vials of cylindrical GNPs, i.e. gold nanorods (GNRs), dispersed in a saline solution (0.3?mg of GNRs/g or 0.03\% of GNRs by weight), as well as vials containing water only, before proton irradiation. MC simulations were also performed with the tool for particle simulation code using the film measurement setup. Additionally, a high-purity germanium detector system was used to measure the photon spectrum originating from activation products created from the interaction of protons and spherical GNPs present in a saline solution (20?mg of GNPs/g or 2\% of GNPs by weight). The dose enhancement due to PIXE/PIGE recorded on the films in the GNR-loaded saline solution was less than the experimental uncertainty of the film dosimetry (<2\%). MC simulations showed highly localized dose enhancement (up to a factor 17) in the immediate vicinity (<100?nm) of GNRs, compared with hypothetical water nanorods (WNRs), mostly due to GNR-originated Auger/secondary electrons; however, the average dose enhancement over the entire GNR-loaded vial was found to be minimal (0.1\%). The dose enhancement due to the activation products from GNPs was minimal (<0.1\%) as well. In conclusion, under the currently investigated conditions that are considered clinically relevant, PIXE, PIGE, and activation products contribute minimally to GNP/GNR-mediated proton dose enhancement, whereas Auger/secondary electrons contribute significantly but only at short distances (<100?nm) from GNPs/GNRs.},

Attribution includes identifying the microbe(s) involved (Breeze et al. 2005) as well as those responsible. The components of microbial forensics described by Breeze et al. include (1) detection and identification of a pathogen; (2) bioinformatics, including genome sequencing and genetic databases; (3) strain repositories for pathogens or microbes of interest as well as their near-neighbors; (4) validation and standardization of forensic methods; and (5) rigorous attention to quality assurance steps. Because forensic casework is subject to vigorous challenge in a court of law, the rigor of standardization and validation of experimental, analytical and application methods goes beyond levels that are normal for typical research and management activities.",

Two broad discrimination models are available that cover biological warfare agents but these are not fully relevant to the scale and nature of intentional foodborne illness outbreaks. Two new models are proposed, one involving a scoring system, evaluated on total points, and another based on a Bayesian Network. The Bayesian Network model is more complex, but deals with uncertainty explicitly. The two proposed models are demonstrated by assessing four known outbreaks, two intentional and two accidental.",

These outbreaks are also responsible from thousands of deaths and billions of dollars' worth of damage every year. However it is considered as an essential portion for a healthy diet, the fresh produce, which is contaminated with Human Pathogens on Plants (HPOPs), is one of the major food items causing this damage. E.coli O104:H4 outbreak, occurred in Germany in 2011, has attracted a great attention on foodborne outbreaks caused by contaminated fresh produce, and especially the vulnerabilities and gaps in the foodborne illness surveillance systems. In the frame of this chapter, we focused on the most common foodborne pathogens on fresh produce, epdimiological and traceback investigations of the outbreaks caused by these pathogens in the last 5 years (November 2010--December 2015) in all around the World.",

abstract="Global biosecurity presents international challenges because the majority of instances of novel organism introductions are due to international movements of goods, food and people and the likelihood of introduced agents crossing political boundaries. The inherent vulnerability of environments to introductions of alien, or non-indigenous, biological agents is due to the greater ecological vulnerability to these exotic entrants in the receiving environment. Agencies and individuals responsible for approving intentional introductions of beneficial organisms recognize this relationship and consider potential impacts in risk assessments prior to release of the organisms. However, some of those responsible for detection and control of novel pathogens and pests, introduced either inadvertently or intentionally, lack extensive training in ecology, environmental biology, and pathology, and may therefore underestimate the risk from such events. The latter is a key factor in the case of food safety. Europe is particularly vulnerable to cross-border movement of introduced agents, and one response to this has been the recent revision of plant health regimes throughout the European Union. Other responses include project-based initiatives, such as PLANTFOODSEC.",

	abstract = { Data interpolation/regularization is needed prior to migration and inversion for acquisition with large data gaps. In the last decade, Minimum Weighted Norm Interpolation (MWNI), which is a spectral density based algorithm, has emerged as a powerful interpolation technique. Till date, most of the MWNI demonstrations have been on single component datasets. In this paper we argue that MWNI may be inherently better suited to multicomponent datasets. The underlying assumption is that the vertical component data records both primary and mode-converted energy which, in certain geological conditions, may interfere to create conflicting move-out dips. Consequently, presence of conflicting dips within the interpolation window degrades interpolation. We show that with multicomponent datasets, the wavefield can be decomposed such that one of the decomposed gather is dominated by primary energy and another(s) is/are dominated by mode-converted energy. MWNI of the mode-decomposed gathers lead to better quality results. We have demonstrated this idea on two synthetic datasets, one from a layered model and another from the Marmousi model. Ongoing work tests the application on real data. Presentation Date: Wednesday, September 27, 2017 Start Time: 11:25 AM Location: Exhibit Hall C/D Presentation Type: POSTER },

	abstract = {Given a non-negative integer k, a graph of minimum degree at least k is called a k-core. The concept of k-cores can be used to design resilient networks that preserve low diameter and high vertex-connectivity upon limited vertex or edge failures. This article focuses on a chance-constrained version of the minimum spanning k-core problem under probabilistic edge failures. Specifically, given that the edges can fail randomly and independently, we want to find a subset of edges of minimum total cost such that the graph with this edge set is a k-core with probability at least 1 - a where a ? [0,1]. We first reformulate the non-convex chance-constrained optimization problem as a large-scale integer program. To solve it, we employ a decomposition and branch-and-cut framework recently introduced in the literature and discuss problem-specific enhancements of this approach. We report on our computational experiments designed to benchmark this decomposition branch-and-cut algorithm. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Nanotechnology is widely considered to profoundly advance multiple industrial sectors. Due to the high costs, low resolution and confounding issues with experimental studies, atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations offer an attractive means to study and address the yield and quality issues in the synthesis of nanostructures. However, current atomistic simulations are hampered by the huge computational overheads. Consequently, they are confined to modeling only the early stages of nanomanufacturing processes. We present a novel nanoinformatics approach using a multi-step local Gaussian process model to capture the nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics of growth process to accelerate MC simulation of nanomanufacturing process, such as synthesis of carbon nanotube (CNT) in chemical vapor deposition. The key idea is that the simulated CNT growth increments were found to exhibit nonlinear, recurring near-stationary dynamics, and lifting the tube structure by the predicted growth increment can put it to near optimum position. Results show that the present approach can save more than 80\% of the computational effort as in traditional MC simulation, leading to the growth of one of the largest CNTs (194 nm long) from atomistic simulations.

	abstract={Passive flow control devices, such as vortex generators or riblets, have limited applications and often provide benefits with the expense of drag or increased cost. Many flow control methods have come and gone due to the lack of practical applications. The Edge Aerodynamix Conformal Vortex Generator (CVG) is different than these previous devices because it has been shown to drastically reduce fuel consumption in transport category aircraft without noticeable adverse side effects. Therefore, this investigation of the CVG device, which will lead to future evaluation and characterization of its leveraged drag mechanism, sought to produce an appropriate scaling relationship for the CVG, reproduce experimental flight test results computationally, and study the properties of the flow at the CVG device. Experimental work was accomplished with water and wind tunnel facilities utilizing flow visualization and particle velocimetry (PIV) flow field measurements. Computational work was accomplished with STAR-CCM+ commercial CFD software and Pointwise grid software. Experimental and computational studies evaluated multiple scaling approaches and found that the CVG device is sensitive to geometrical and boundary layer properties. Computational simulation results reproduced wall shear stress patterns observed in Edge Aerodynamix flight tests. 2D flow simulations over specific airfoil sections, which correspond to Edge Aerodynamix flight test vehicles, were produced to provide flow boundary layer properties at the CVG device. The transonic shock oscillating behavior was investigated through visualization videos during fuel consumption flight tests, which suggested that the CVG device may dampen high-frequency shock oscillations; and therefore, could account for significant drag reduction. This work was limited by the lack of an adequate experimental scaling relationship and subsequent experimental results for CFD validation. However, a scaling approach was identified for future experimental testing. Additionally, the computational work was limited by the turbulence model used and the lower-order discretization schemes employed, and therefore, future work should build upon the recommendations presented. The work accomplished will lead to further scaling development and ultimately the evaluation and characterization of the CVG drag device.},

	abstract={Juniperus (Cupressaceae) is regarded as a major source of airborne allergens due to its wide distribution and heavy pollen production. Juniperus species have invaded millions of acres of rangelands, abandoned farms, fields and grasslands. Under favorable conditions, a considerable amount of the Juniperus pollen can be transported and deposited far from its place of origin. Monitoring pollen is based on conventional air sampling and microscopic counting techniques that are labor-intensive and may be limited to identification at the genus or family level. Juniperus ashei, J. pinchotii and J. virginiana were chosen as our target organisms as they are abundant in Southern United States. Transmission electron microscopy, PCR and sequencing studies were used to confirm the presence of plastids in pollen grains and, thus, to develop plastid primers for the amplification of DNA from Juniperus pollen. These species-specific plastid primers were utilized to verify the long-distance transport of J. ashei. Our studies also aimed at using an alternative method known as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique in place of microscopy to differentiate between three species of Juniperus in their overlapping pollination seasons. The general absence of genomic data available for these pollen types, however, has resulted in the dependence on transcriptome-mining in search of single-copy nuclear markers. The nuclear markers and the plastid markers were utilized in qPCR experiments to evaluate the pollen concentration in air samples and to test hypotheses regarding overlapping pollination seasons in Juniperus. The qPCR approach was also used to analyze archived air-samples. To determine suitable habitats in the future (2070), species distribution modelling was used to predict the range shift, areas susceptible to encroachment through 2070 for J. monosperma along with the other three Juniperus species. The results from TEM studies confirmed the presence of plastids in Juniperus pollen. Plastid genes rbcL and matK were successfully amplified from J. ashei, J. pinchotii and J. virginiana pollen DNA. The PCR results with species-specific J. ashei primers provided absolute evidence of long-distance transport of mountain cedar pollen to London, Ontario, Canada, approximately 2400 km from the source. The transcriptome-mining studies yielded two single-copy nuclear markers that were used in the molecular identification and quantification of J. pinchotii and J. virginiana pollen grains. Pollen concentrations from the qPCR data were significantly correlated with light microscopy data. Evidence of overlapping pollination seasons was detected in both current and archived air samples. Species distribution modeling studies indicated that the centroid of the habitats are shifting northward for all four Juniperus species.},
